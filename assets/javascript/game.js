// 3. Guess what letter I'm thinking of
// First Step: computer has to guess a letter. The letters has to be stored in a variable. 

// 4. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
//Want user to see wins and the number of time letters guessed correctly. Create variable for wins in HTML user can see

// 5. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
//Want user to see loses and the number of time letters guessed correctly. Create variable for loses in HTML user can see

// 6. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
//Want the number of guesses left. Create variable for guesses in HTML user can see

// 7. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
//Want to see the letters that the user has guessed so far. 

// 8. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
//Take win and add to existing wins being displayed in HTML

// 9. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
//Make page reload if user loses and add the lose to their loss counter visible using HTML.
